### Stylelint

We use [StyleLint](https://stylelint.io/) to avoid errors and enforce consistent
conventions in the stylesheets.

- `npm run lint:css` StyleLint allows us to:

- use plugins to enforce conventions
- use custom plugins to enforce design system rules like 0.25rem multiples for

  spacing

- detect subtle mistakes like overriding shorthand properties
- opt-in to a small subset of the CSS language it to keep things consistent and

  easy to use/learnCSS

- enforce conventions that make it easier to collaborate and review code liked

ordered declarations
