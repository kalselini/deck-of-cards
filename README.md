## <a name="lint">JS and CSS Linting üßπ</a>

### Stylelint

We use [StyleLint](https://stylelint.io/) to avoid errors and enforce consistent
conventions in the stylesheets.

- `npm run lint:css` StyleLint allows us to:

- use plugins to enforce conventions
- use custom plugins to enforce design system rules like 0.25rem multiples for

  spacing

- detect subtle mistakes like overriding shorthand properties
- opt-in to a small subset of the CSS language it to keep things consistent and

  easy to use/learnCSS

- enforce conventions that make it easier to collaborate and review code liked

ordered declarations

Project-wide configuration is defined in `stylelint.config.js`

### ESLint

`npm run lint:js` Project-wide configuration is defined in `eslintrc.js` , but
packages may override these defaults by placing an `.eslintrc` file in the
package folder.

## <a name="tests">Tests üìä</a>

We use [@testing-library](https://testing-library.com/) to run unit and snapshot
tests where available across the application.

Project-wide config, including code coverage can be found in `./jest.config.js`
